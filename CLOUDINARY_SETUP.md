# ✅ Cloudinary Configuration Complete

## Your Cloudinary Details

- **Cloud Name**: `dgr2x7dn9`
- **API Key**: `438679998912743`
- **API Secret**: (You have this in your Cloudinary dashboard - keep it secret!)

## What's Added to `.env`

```env
# Backend URL for WebSocket
BACKEND_URL=https://weldiwinbackend-git-main-kaaboura12s-projects.vercel.app

# Cloudinary Storage URL
CLOUD_STORAGE_URL=https://res.cloudinary.com/dgr2x7dn9
```

## What to Send to Your Friend

Send them these exact values:

```
BACKEND_URL=https://weldiwinbackend-git-main-kaaboura12s-projects.vercel.app
CLOUD_STORAGE_URL=https://res.cloudinary.com/dgr2x7dn9
```

## For Vercel Environment Variables

Add these to your Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to Vercel → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add:
   - `BACKEND_URL` = `https://weldiwinbackend-git-main-kaaboura12s-projects.vercel.app`
   - `CLOUD_STORAGE_URL` = `https://res.cloudinary.com/dgr2x7dn9`

## Note About API Secret

Your API Secret is hidden in Cloudinary for security. If you need it later for direct file uploads, you can:
1. Go to Cloudinary Dashboard → Settings → API Keys
2. Click on your API key to reveal the secret (or generate a new one)

For now, the `CLOUD_STORAGE_URL` is enough for the message system to work!
